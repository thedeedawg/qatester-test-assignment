# PHPUnit Test Assignment
This assignment is designed to test the basic understanding of unit testing using the PHPUnit framework.

The test includes a calculator class which has different operators. All operators needs to be covered with unit tests, so we know that it works as expected.

## Objectives
The following objectives should be completed.

- As close to 100% code coverage as possible.
- Utilize the use of fixtures and data providers.

## Result
What we expect to reviece from you when the assignment has been completed.

- A folder named `tests` which contains the different test cases.
- It must be possible to run PHPUnit and execute the tests within the `tests` folder without any further configurations.
- If a `phpunit.xml` is used then it must included as well.

## Notes
- It's recomended to use Composer (https://getcomposer.org/).
